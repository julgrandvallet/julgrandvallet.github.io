I am a dedicated Molecular Biologist using bioinformatics for cancer research. With hands-on experience in RNA-seq methodologies, single-cell sequencing analysis, and a strong background in cancer stem cells and genomics, I analyze and interpreting large-scale genomic datasets. Proficient in R and Bash scripting, I am passionate about extracting meaningful insights from transcriptomic data, especially in the realm of childhood leukemia.
